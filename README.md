🌾 Field2Market

Field2Market is a community-driven web platform designed to connect local farmers directly with buyers. The goal of the project is to reduce barriers to market access by giving farmers a simple way to showcase and post their produce online, while allowing customers to easily browse what’s available in their community.

Farmers can list fresh produce with relevant details, and buyers can view available items without relying on middlemen. This helps support local agriculture, improve visibility for small-scale farmers, and encourage sustainable community trade.

This project was built as part of a community initiative to apply web development skills to a real-world problem and create meaningful social impact.
